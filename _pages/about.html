      <h2>Hey, I'm Anabel</h2>
      <p>
        I spent way too much time trying to figure out the perfect way to explain what this blog means to me—
        why I started it, why I care, and why you might want to stick around. But I kept getting stuck trying to
        <em>perfectly</em> express my passion for questions around the future of tech… instead of just starting the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, here it is: I’m Anabel. I have a background in finance, a deep fascination with economics and technology,
        and a brain that won’t stop chasing questions.

    <h2>Why I’m Here</h2>
    <p>
      I believe if we embrace technology thoughtfully, we can grow from it—and with it.
      But if we reject it or ignore it, we risk something deeper: not just being left behind,
      but slowly losing our humanity to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m just a scientist, trying to hypothesize where this AI race is headed. And honestly?
      I have way more questions than answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my thoughts come from curiosity—and from the limited information we currently have
      about AI safety, ethics, and how machines actually learn.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Is the fear around AI just humanity’s 100th doomsday theory?<br>
      Or is it something more real—like discovering fire and not knowing whether it will warm us or burn us to the ground?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That’s what I want to explore. Not with certainty, but with questions. With you.
    </p>

    <h2>Why AI Feels So Human</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond buzzwords like “Technological Singularity,” there are real-time conversations
      we need to be having about AI. Conversations that don’t just belong to engineers or CEOs—but to all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      What pulled me in the most is that AI is inherently interdisciplinary. It’s the first field I’ve found where all my curiosities converge. They emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is where I get to explore all the frameworks, theories, and side-quests I’ve been following for years—
      and finally bring them into conversation with something bigger. With you.
    </p>

    <h2>A Few Ground Rules</h2>
    <p>
      I’m not here to be an expert. I’m not here to die on any theoretical hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you disagree with something I say—connect with me! Enlighten me! That’s the whole point.
      Everything I write comes from a place of respect—whether I touch on religion, gender, mental health, or anything else.
      These are my opinions, shaped by my lens. I hope yours are rooted in critical thinking too. Let’s trade lenses sometimes.
    </p>

    <h2>Rabbit Holes I’m Chasing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Dead Internet Theory</li>
      <li>The Technological Singularity</li>
      <li>The History of Intelligence</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      If you’re confused about how they’re all connected… good.
      That means you’re not a large language model. You’re a human. Just like me.
      And now, we get to be confused together.
    </p>

    <h2>PS: A Note on How I Write</h2>
    <p>
      I bow to keep my articles as close to human as possible.
      Yes, I use generative AI to help me clean up structure and grammar—but I want every conversation here to sound like me, not a bot.
      If you ever feel like something sounds robotic, call me out. I’m learning too.
