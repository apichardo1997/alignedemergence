  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>👋 Hey, I'm Anabel</h2>
    <p>
      I spent way too much time trying to figure out the perfect way to explain what this blog means to me—
      why I started it, why I care, and why you might want to stick around. But I kept getting stuck trying to
      <em>perfectly</em> express my passion for questions around the future of tech… instead of just starting the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, here it is: I’m Anabel. I have a background in finance, a deep fascination with economics and technology,
      and a brain that won’t stop chasing questions.
    </p>

    <h2>🧠 Why I’m Here</h2>
    <p>
      I believe if we embrace technology thoughtfully, we can grow from it—and with it. But if we reject it or ignore it,
      we risk something deeper: not just being left behind, but slowly losing our humanity <em>to</em> it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m just a scientist, trying to hypothesize where this AI race is headed. And honestly? I have <em>way</em> more questions than answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my thoughts come from curiosity—and from the limited information we currently have about AI safety, ethics, and how machines actually learn.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Is the fear around AI just humanity’s 100th doomsday theory?<br />
        Or is it something more real—like discovering fire and not knowing whether it will warm us or burn us to the ground?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That’s what I want to explore. Not with certainty, but with questions. With you.</p>

    <h2>🤯 Why AI Feels So Human</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the buzzwords like “Technological Singularity,” there are real-time, everyday conversations we <em>need</em>
      to be having about AI. Conversations that don’t just belong to engineers or CEOs—but to all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s what pulled me in the most: <strong>AI is <em>inherently</em> interdisciplinary</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s the first field I’ve found where all my curiosities aren’t scattered—they converge. They <em>emerge</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is where I get to explore all the frameworks, theories, and side-quests I’ve been following on my own for years—
      and finally bring them into conversation with something bigger. With <em>you</em>.

    <h2>🤝 A Few Ground Rules</h2>
    <p>
      I’m not here to be an expert. I’m not here to die on any theoretical hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you disagree with something I say—connect with me! Enlighten me! That’s the whole point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything I write comes from a place of respect—whether I touch on religion, gender, mental health, or anything else.
      These are <em>my</em> opinions, shaped by my lens, and I hope yours are rooted in critical thinking too. Let’s trade lenses sometimes.

    <h2>🕳️ Rabbit Holes I’m Chasing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Dead Internet Theory</li>
      <li>The Technological Singularity</li>
      <li>The History of Intelligence</li>
      <li>Ancient philosophical frameworks on moral reasoning, consciousness, and existentialism</li>
      <li>Capitalist Realism</li>
      <li>Darwinism and Evolution</li>
      <li>Hauntology and Lost Futures</li>
      <li>Mental Health</li>
      <li>Psychology and Cognitive Science</li>
      <li>Game Theory</li>
      <li>Anthropology and Sociology</li>
      <li>Political Science and Law</li>
      <li>Ethics</li>
      <li>The Beginning (and Potential End) of Human Invention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some of these are broad. Some are niche. Some sound like conspiracy theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re confused about how they’re all connected… good. That means you’re <em>not</em> a large language model.
      You’re a human. Just like me.
    </p>
    <p>And now, we get to be confused together. :)</p>

    <h2>🤖 PS: A Note on How I Write</h2>
    <p>
      I <em>bow</em> to keep my articles as close to human as possible.  
      Yes, I use generative AI to help me clean up structure and grammar—but I want every conversation here to sound like <em>me</em>, not a bot.
      If you ever feel like something sounds robotic, call me out. I’m learning too.
