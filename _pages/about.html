    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
      <p>I come from finance. I’m earning my master’s in CS and data science. But really? I’m just someone who’s led by questions.</p>
      <p>This blog is my space to explore what it means to stay human in a world increasingly shaped by machines. I think curiosity is underrated — and we should start asking better questions before the future answers them for us.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why I Started This</h2>
    <p>I think if we embrace tech, we can grow from it and with it. If we reject it, we’ll regress as a species — and humans might actually lose our humanity to tech.</p>
    <p>I'm just a scientist trying to hypothesize where this AI race will take us. I have more questions than I have answers. I have a lot of opinions, based on the limited information we currently have about AI safety, ethics, and how machines really learn.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Questions That Keep Me Up</h2>
    <p>Is the hype around AI — and the threat to humanity — just the 100th doomsday theory we humans are obsessed with? I don’t know. And that’s what I want to explore.</p>
    <p>Is AI the 21st-century version of discovering fire — wondering whether it will be the thing that lights the way forward or burns us to the ground?</p>
    <p>Like I said, I have more questions than I have answers. But maybe we can at least have more inclusive conversations around something that feels like one of the most important matters of our lifetime.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What This Blog Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
    <p>I’ve been digging into these ideas for years. Some through books, some through rabbit holes, some just through observation. I’m a very curious person, and this blog is just that — an exploration. Not a lecture.</p>
    <p>I'm not an expert. I'm learning in real time, so I won't die on any hill. If you disagree with something I say, connect with me, correct me. That’s the point.</p>
    <p> I’ll always be respectful of people’s livelihoods, religion, gender, and anything else that might naturally come up. These are <em>my</em> opinions. Please take them with a grain of salt — they’re mine for a reason. And if you’ve got your own? I hope they’re rooted in critical thinking too.</p>

  <div class="section" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What I’m Exploring</h2>
    <p>AI is inherently interdisciplinary — and that’s what draws me in. These are some of the threads I plan to follow:</p>

    <div class="topics-grid" style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 2rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">

      <div class="topic-cluster" style="flex: 1 1 250px;">

  <div class="section" style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What to Expect</h2>
    <p>I write the way I think — curiously, conversationally, sometimes out loud.</p>
    <p>Some weeks I deep dive into a single question. Other times, I connect dots across disciplines that might not seem related at first. Recent explorations have covered everything from whether AI can be creative, to how ancient philosophy shows up in machine learning.</p>
    <p>I use generative AI to help with structure and editing — but every idea, voice, and question here is mine. If something ever sounds robotic, call me out. I'm learning too.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">If You're Confused... Same</h2>
    <p>Some of these are broad. Some are niche. Some sound like conspiracy theories.</p>
    <p>If you’re confused about how they all connect — good. That means you’re not a large language model.</p>
    <p>You’re a human. Just like me.</p>
    <p>And now we get to be confused together. :)</p>
