  <h2 style="font-size: 2.2rem;">Hi, I’m Anabel.</h2>

  <p>I’m earning my master’s in computer science and data science.</p>

  <p>This blog is where I explore what it means to stay human in a world increasingly shaped by machines.</p>

  <p>I don’t have all the answers, but I think curiosity is underrated, and we should start asking better questions before the future answers them for us.</p>

    <h2>Why I Started This</h2>
    <p>I believe if we embrace technology thoughtfully, we can grow from it—and with it. But if we reject it or ignore it,
      we risk not just being left behind, but slowly losing our humanity.</p>
    <p>What pulls me in the most: <strong>AI is <em>inherently</em> interdisciplinary</strong>.</p>
    <p>It’s the first field I’ve found where all my curiosities aren’t scattered—they converge. They <em>emerge</em>.</p>
    <p>This blog is where I get to explore all the frameworks, theories, and side-quests I’ve been following on my own for years—and finally bring them into the conversation.</p>
    <p>Beyond the headlines and fear mongering, there are real-time, everyday conversations we <em>need</em>
      to be having about AI. Conversations that don’t just belong to engineers or CEOs—but to all of us.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Questions That Keep Me Up</h2>
    <p>Is the hype around AI — and the threat to humanity — just the 100th doomsday theory we are focused on at the moment?</p>
    <p>Is AI the 21st-century version of discovering fire — wondering whether it will be the thing that lights the way forward or burns us to the ground?</p>
    <p>Like I said, I have more questions than I have answers. But maybe we can at least have more inclusive conversations around something that feels like one of the most important matters of our lifetime.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What This Blog Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
    <p>I’ve been digging into these ideas for years. Some through books, some through rabbit holes, some just through observation. I’m a very curious person, and this blog is just that — an exploration. Not a lecture.</p>
    <p> I won't die on any hill. If you disagree with something I say, connect with me, maybe enlighten me. That’s the point.</p>
    <p>I’ll always be respectful of people’s livelihoods, religion, gender, and anything else that might naturally come up. These are <em>my</em> opinions. Please take them with a grain of salt — they’re mine for a reason. And if you’ve got your own? I hope they’re rooted in critical thinking too.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>I write the way I think: curiously, conversationally.</p>
    <p>Some weeks I deep dive into a single question. Other times, I connect dots across disciplines that might not seem related at first.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>If You're Confused... Same</h2>
    <p>Some of these are broad. Some are niche. Some sound like conspiracy theories.</p>
    <p>If you’re confused about how they all connect: good. That means you’re not a large language model.</p>
    <p>You’re a human. Just like me.</p>
    <p>And now we get to be confused together. :)</p>
