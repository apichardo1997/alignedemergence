    paragraphs:
      - I didn’t grow up wanting to work in tech. I grew up asking too many questions—about people, systems, why we love, why we break, and what we repeat. Eventually, those questions took me across countries and spreadsheets until they landed me in the world of algorithms.
      - **Aligned Emergence** is my digital field notebook. A place where machine logic meets human intuition. Where I get to map out what happens when we stop trying to predict the future, and instead ask better questions about the present.
      - I care about AI not because it’s new—but because it mirrors us. It’s a magnifying glass. A reflection. A challenge. And sometimes, a tool for reimagining what kind of world we want to live in. I write here to stay curious, stay accountable, and stay human.
      - If you’re someone who asks a lot of questions—about tech, about society, about why the world is the way it is—you’re in the right place.
